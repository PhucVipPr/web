The owners, following your presentation and technical information report are fully onboard with you developing their website. They would like a design that captures their current stock and new arrivals. They would like information on their website about events such as auctions and themed days at their barn warehouse in Suffolk looking at different types of antiques, focusing on different periods, different types e.g., ‘furniture’ or ‘paintings’. Feature pages of special items for sales and online purchasing has also been discussed.
The information provided by BKC should support you in creating a design document and from that a branded, multipage website supported with realistic content.
The design document should showcase a multipage website, supported with medium fidelity wireframes (giving details about the layout and how things will work/function) and a full set of client and user requirements. Once the design document is complete with appropriate principles, standards, and guidelines you will then move onto physically producing a branded, multipage website supported with realistic content for BKC.
For the benefit of the owners, you will also need to include supporting documentation justifying what you have done, why and what testing that has taken place.
Provide written and /or visual evidence of the following:

● A critical evaluation of the design and development process for the website against the
design document analyzing any technical challenges. At the very least, the evaluation
should compare the multipage website that you have created to the original design document.

● A suitable test plan that identifies key performance areas. Use this to review the
functionality and performance of BKCs website.

● Provide an evaluation of the Quality Assurance (QA) process and review how this was
implemented during the design and development stages.
For the IT administrator you have agreed to provide a critical evaluation of the test plan 
results including a review of the overall success of the multipage website. This evaluation 
can be used to identify areas of success, but also provide justified recommendations for 
areas that require improvement in the future, if the business wishes to expand or embrace e-commerce further.
